  Amanda Cmrg, Amandita, Amandica, Amandinha, Mandy, A.<br/>
  <span class="name">AMANDA CAMARGO</span>
  designer, mind & heart.<br/>
  <div class="comentario">Amanda is a creative multidisciplinary designer who lives and works in Brazil. Works with branding, editorial design, print and digital media, and posters. After leaving work, she is dedicating herself to personal projects like this or meeting a friend for a coffee (or beer) to talk about life in general. She believes that for every problem there’s a solution, and everything can be improved. Also, Amanda believes that a good project involves observation, study, dedication and if possible a ‘human being’ side, and some of her projects show that. Among her interests are wolves and grape popsicles on hot days. Her favorite geometric shape is the triangle, she lives stumbling while walking because she likes to look at the sky to check the phases of the moon, and sometimes creates a dispute with herself looking for the brighter and the less bright star.

  <div class="comentario">Beautiful on the inside and the outside, creative, cheerful, sarcastic (yes or surely?). Truth is, Little Mandy steals everyone’s hearts just being herself! Always helpful, a good listener – and adviser –, she’s very hardworking. Full of quirks, she never leaves anything unfinished or without her final touch, the one that makes everything more beautiful. Very critic, hard mainly on herself, she has an enormous heart to her friends and the world (after all, grabbing a backpack and wandering out there takes a lot of courage and this girl has courage to give).</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">It might be her mistrust and curiosity that make Amanda so professional. Although those adjectives may sound like a negative point to many people, in her they come out as qualities. Not that she doesn’t trust her guts, but the girl knows she can be better in what she does, as well as in living with other people (yeah, though the first impression of her might be 'a bit reserved’, you end up laughing with her sharp sense of humour). To her, nothing is ever finished, everything can be improved with study, experimentation, discussion – something I learned to use in my life as well.</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">Half girl, half woman, she got my attention and affection very quickly. It amazes me that she’s not a shallow person. She’s someone with whom you can dive deep and be sure to never be alone, whatever the journey may be; she’s constantly evolving and reflecting and has power and attitude (both to get to something and to defend herself or her friends). An outspoken person, definitely, she doesn’t fear the truth, the real and sincere and this makes her a transparent and respectable person. These are very few words to describe such a dense person, but this is some of the light that reflects from this prism :)</div></div></div>

  actress, psychologist, friend.<br/>
  <div class="comentario">Amanda, to me, is somebody that gathers the charms of being a highly sensitive woman with hard principles and a rigid way to see the world around her. Tough by nature, she makes strong and durable bonds of her relationships. A special person that everybody should have the privilege to meet. Intense and loyal, Amanda tries to always do the best for her friends. She ends up being jealous for liking too much. Competent and hardworking, she is always learning new things. Amanda is someone with a long way ahead of her: she makes plans, lives, loves, cries, smiles, screams, thanks… but, best of all: she expresses herself.</div></div></div>

  advertiser, sister, best friend.<br/>
  <div class="comentario">Amanda is my tough sister who’s 24 years old but has experience of 42. Or at least that’s what she tries to show. But she’s demanding and sentimental. Being intimate with her is like going to a battle, it takes courage, sentiment and compromise above all. She has arguments to everything, at home, at work, on the street. As she likes space, it’s normal to her creating and centralizing it as hers. She grabs things and leaves them at her reach, and has a great mood for dreaming. That might be the reason for attracting so many people around her, because of the great smile, the discrete sarcasms and the secret willings of a good future. After you get to know all the expressions and raised eyebrows, you accept her in all senses. She has the kind of look that you can’t stand, but that is among other ones that you’d die for, because she is worth it. Love you.</div></div></div>

She knows how to deal with any kind of situation and how to help everyone who’s around, making sure everybody is fine. A girl with all the good of the world, who wants all the world to be well too. This is not much, but it’s summarized, about an amazing and joyful person that I am lucky enough to be friends with and whom I’ll never forget.</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">I'll try not to think too much, to ensure the integrity of the answer. The first thing I think is a rough diamond. A person with well-established values and undeniable character, but still lack the stoning that life and time brings. Demands a lot of herself, which reflects the way she sees the world. (I'm feeling like talking about myself years ago!) You are a person who, as I said, have an undeniable character. You are sincere, passionate about your opinions and articulate them very well. She has a huge sweetness and dedication for the people she loves. She has curiosity for new things and eagerness to learn.</div></div></div>

I think Amanda is super reserved and confidant only to her best friends. Despite the "tough" stance, she is affectionate and loving. (:</div></div></div>

For a while, I thought what connected us was the feeling of gratitude for the help when we weren’t so close, but is more than that. It must be because she gives the impression of a person who is not pleased easily, you need to win her, because of her honest and direct way. But there she was, listening to me and being all sweet. In fact, for me, the best quality Amanda is being a good listener, those who pays attention until you feel free to say anything, without fear of waiting for her (always honest) opinion, because she is sensible and fully of good intentions.</div></div></div>

I get the impression that you are a person who enjoys playing what you do, but if I were supposed to hire you, I’ll worry about how long you can stay committed to the same project, if you sickens fast or not. This concern in defining who you are shows a trauma by relationship problems at work in the past or difficulty in separating the personal from the professional.</div></div></div>

Then there's the charming, and you think “how come!”, she is beautiful, smart, conveys maturity and owns a genuine sarcasm (her strongest thing). She has a smile of a tomboy and is friendly, but that's the only part that gives me fear, a fear that it’s can be just for politeness, because for real, I would like to mean just a little to her. Even her grumpy touch I think it's cool, it's so hers.</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">A girl with an outstanding talent, she’s going to go even farther than she imagines with all her dreams. This chorus, from Aquarela by Vinicius de Moraes, reminds me of you, an artist that lives life quite well. "Numa folha qualquer eu desenho um navio de partida, Com alguns bons amigos, bebendo de bem com a vida, De uma América a outra consigo passar num segundo, Giro um simples compasso e num círculo eu faço o mundo, Um menino caminha e caminhando chega num muro, E ali logo em frente a esperar pela gente o futuro está".</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">First of all, Amanda is a good person. She has her own principles which guide her life. And she has well defined goals, knowing where she wants to be, how she pictures herself in the future. To achieve all that, she acts with focus and honesty, always looking for her friends’ and family’s support. She’s an spontaneous person, joyful, sincere and with great taste in music. I’m so glad and honored to have her in my life, she’s a friend that adds so much to me.</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">Amandita is a sincere person, which believes and always seeks the best in people, many times demanding it of them. She has an ironic sense of humour, sometimes being a little sarcastic (although the biggest problem on that is when she uses this irony while fighting). She’s a strong person with an enormous heart, respects people and cultivates well her friendships. Very creative and responsible, her trademark is always being late to appointments with her friends. She thinks a lot about herself, but also always worries about the others and puts herself in their shoes. To end, I’d say two words that define her commitment with people: fidelity and loyalty.</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">Amanda is a person I have known for many years and always impressed me for being a sincere and genuine person. A person with character, personality, while being at the same time sweet and friendly. Amanda calls my attention for her quick wit and intelligence. She is a very perceptive, sensitive and thorough person. She likes perfection and excellence in her actions and conduct. I also emphasize her loyalty and friendship, a quality that I value very much on people and Amanda has a great sense of friendship and fellowship. On the downside or to be worked, she is impatience. In all, it is a very quick person, creative, fearless and able to exercise with planning and masterfully the professional tasks that she will be asked for.</div></div></div>

Despite knowing both a little, I believe Amanda is who I had more contact, so perhaps I know separating one from another by her . The first thing that came to my mind was her smile, which is kind of shy, but scrolls a hint of recognition, I can not explain.</div></div></div>

She has her opinion well-defined, and takes sides in what she believes. For me, her posture is admirable. Formal but in ideal measure. She knows how to use portuguese with ease and always surprises me with fully usable comments. She is affectionate and know when needs to take care of those she loves.</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">I want to start talking about us. New Years’ Eve 2009/2010: one of my favorite movie scenes ever is from The Curious Case of Benjamin Button (ok, Amelie Poulain is close, but this one is more significant to me, guess it’s more direct), when he shows how a ballerina had her foot broken. Here is the video <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pQ4Bu700Bw">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8pQ4Bu700Bw</a>. I also think a lot about the “what ifs…” of that year. You could have given up when you lost the bus, I could never have come back from Vienna, we could be short on money, there are SO MANY events in this life that could have changed our story, but no… it was part of life’s plans, we had to meet, and it had to be love at first sight (or second, after all you were friends with Rafa Niko hahah). Little Mandy, four years have gone since then. Four years in which I could watch the development of an incredible person, with a pure heart and a hug full of love. I find awesome that you want to learn more about yourself, these things can never be too much. Unfortunately, having a good heart these days is not guarantee of success (yeah, we suffer from that). I saw you hardening your heart, learning to hide when weeping, saw you back on your feet when you thought something was the end of the world (and saw it more than once). You taught me that “one step at a time” thing, when getting to hug you was already the best thing that could happen to someone temporarily lost. I admire so much your guts – you cry, unburden yourself, create all theories imaginable, but after all has passed you’re like a bear that has hibernated long enough to be ready to hunt again. Although I exceeded the 200 characters, all I have to say to you now is: never let this beauty of yours die. Hardening your heart is necessary, but suffering is very beautiful, since you have strength to start again. I love this cycle of yours, never lose this, even if it appears tempting sometimes. Life will knock us down many times yet, Mandy, and you can be sure that I’ll be here to see you go through it all, sometimes with your head on my shoulder and sometimes with your head on. I love you, I admire you very much and I am so very proud of you.</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">Boring, but a lovely one. I have yet to meet a more committed and responsible person than you. You can’t go wrong, you bring a lot of security and commitment in all that you claims to do. And from the first moment I met you, in addition to antipathy, I thought you were the “mature” of the group. After the chaotic period of recognition, I was able to see the loyal, sincere (too much) and lovely friend you are. And all this makes your timing and rudeness often were nothing compared with all of your qualities. I usually say that I like to meet good people, but for good I mean in character, values, and I found this in you. That's all folks. In professional area, Amanda, I have no doubt that simply everything you do is great. Unlike me, you are a complete designer. You can create in all design areas, oops, except one - the drawing hand. But in this digital world, it is already outmoded. Well, the summary of the opera, I think you're a phenomenal person, independent, mature, complete professionally. Personally, my comments are described in highest praise I can illustrate here, but of course I have to talk about for weakness, because after all I love to tease you.</div></div></div>

  <div class="comentario">I believe Amanda is one of the most politically correct people I’ve ever met in my almost 25 years. In every sense. With a simplicity that’s solely hers, I know she likes good company and cultivates her relationships like no one. Many times I have thought that this straight-forward way (as to say, she speaks what has to be spoken, with no evasion) was somewhat rude, but now, writing about her I see that it really is her loyal nature, this attitude not always ‘so romantic’ is a good measure to speak and know the truth. Talking to her is always great, speak whatever comes to your mind and she’ll know what to answer. Everything on her is made of such a huge and sincere infinite that I can only come with good things to say (even if not so clearly). Anyway, Amanda is a real person, with flaws and all, but also with many qualities, you’d have to meet her to know! And really, you should give her the benefit of the doubt.</div></div></div>

      <p>In the midst of my relentless pursuit of self-knowledge, improving skills and balancing between personal and professional, this project intends to show part of what some people from my little big universe have to say about me.</p>
      <p>I sent a casual message to my best friends, co-workers, fellows from college and even some not well-known people in my social circle:<br/>WHO IS AMANDA CMRG?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="column">
      <span>_the proposal</span>
      <p>A comment up to 200 characters about Amanda. Any answer would be enough; it could be a word, a comment, a report, a review, a memory, a compliment, a weakness, in short, anything – provided that it was true. I made sure that I’d not rule any comment and would not be upset if it was not positive – on the contrary, I would be happy to know it.</p>
      <p>To thank each of them, I’d give a glass of beer or a hug. The most chosen was my embrace – even skinny –, others had both them, and some even asked me to write about them, the same idea of the project. It was fair.</p>
      <p>In addition to this interactive site, the printed version of it became a book titled "My Universe" - the first edition was released in dec/2014. The intention is to continue the project and every two years have an issue showing more comments from different people about me - which I know throughout the year. The book is divided into 4 parts "Who / What / When / How" and do not have forecast to end. If you want to check it out, just click in this <a href="https://www.behance.net/gallery/21847277/MY-UNIVERSE">link</a>.</p>

    <div class="column">
      <span>_the result</span>
      <p>Almost 70 comments from different people and 5 levels of proximity. Joining words, sincerity, universe, creativity, design and dedication to develop a personal and professional project.</p>
      <p>If you’re not in the project and you know me, send me an email with a comment about what you think of the project or if you have any comment about me. </p>
      <p>At last, my universe is getting bigger.</p>
